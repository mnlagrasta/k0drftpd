= K0DRftpd =

== Overview ==
Absolute minimal FTP server meant to receive incoming connections from Canon and Nikon camera wireless file transmitters.
Apparently, the camera manufacturers can't/won't/haven't implemented SFTP and meanwhile Apple dropped (or hid) FTP support with the release of OS X Lion.
It should also work with many other similar devices and FTP clients.

For more info, check k0dr.com or lagrasta.com

== Installation ==

* Install NodeJS (http://nodejs.org)
* Copy this repo to your hard drive

== Usage ==

{{{node k0drftpd.js}}}

You can get extra help using the -h or --help param.

== Attention Notice Warning Alert ==
At this time, there is NO SECURITY enforced in this server.
It's fine for use within a private network when you can start the server only when needed.

== Future Plans ==
I'd like to add a way to submit a list of valid user logins. I've got the hooks in place, but the code isn't functional.

I'm also watching the AppJS project for updates on the Mac version, which will allow me to package this up as "native" looking application.

== Credits ==
The core of the FTP server code comes directly from alanszlosek's fork of nodeftpd which can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/alanszlosek/nodeftpd. All I did was put a wrapper around it, but I figured someone else might find it useful.
